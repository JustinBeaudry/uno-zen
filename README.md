# Uno Spaced for Ghost

> Minimalist and Spaced out theme for Ghost.

## Introduction

**Uno Spaced** is a fork of [Uno Zen](https://github.com/kikobeats/uno-zen) which is itself a fork of [Uno for Ghost](https://github.com/daleanthony/Uno).
This fork follows comparable design patterns but attempts to clean-up the code-base, removes the dependency on jQuery.

## Installation

Please ensure that `git` and `curl` is installed on your machine.

Enter the theme folder (`content/themes`) of your Ghost installation and paste the following command:

```bash
$ curl -sSL http://git.io/vcIHr | sh
```
